# Vuka's Sudoku 🎀

Welcome to **Vuka's Sudoku**, a simple and playful Sudoku game I created for my daughter.

## ❤️ Why I Made This

My daughter is five years old and absolutely loves Sudoku. Every morning before kindergarten, she would ask me to draw her a new Sudoku board—using markers, coloring each square differently. And we did that for days. At some point, I thought:

> *Why not build her something digital, something she can play anytime she wants?*

That's how this little project was born. It's not some grand piece of software, but it came straight from the heart—as a gift for her, and maybe for another child who enjoys puzzles just as much.

## ✨ What the Game Offers

* 🎨 A 4x4 board, divided into four colorful sections
* 🍀 Grid squares with clover-pattern background
* 🔊 Background music (with a toggle to turn on/off)
* 📱 Fully responsive and mobile-friendly
* 🔁 Buttons for: New Game, Undo Move, Toggle Music
* 🧠 Live mistake checking – incorrect moves are highlighted
* 🎆 Firework animation when the puzzle is solved
* 🧩 Randomly generated new board each time
* 📦 Installable as a mobile app (PWA)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **React** – for the user interface
* **Vite** – fast frontend build tool
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – for game logic
* **HTML/CSS** – for structure and styling
* **Vite Plugin PWA** – to enable installation as a web app
* **Responsive Design** – mobile-first styling with CSS

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open in your browser: `http://localhost:5173`

## 📂 How to Add Music

Download your desired music file and place it in the `public/` folder as `muzika.mp3`. The game will automatically play it on load.

I hope another kid enjoys this just half as much as Vuka did while we tested every square together.

Thank you, Vuka. ❤️
